#Outbreak

An implementation of the classic arcade game *Breakout* made by Louis webb using libGDX.  This game can be distributed on desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux), in browser, and on Android.

##Gameplay

Use the arrow keys (desktop, browser) or tilt your device (mobile) to move the platform back and forth.  The goal is to break all the blocks by deflecting the ball into them without letting the ball drop past the bottom of the screen.
